# HotelFinder_Application
This project is a C++ implementation of a hotel finding application, hotelFinder, as part of an advanced programming assignment. hotelFinder is designed to allow users to efficiently manage and search for hotel records within a specified city using a unique combination of hotel name and city name as the search key. Each record contains detailed information such as hotel name, city name, star rating, price, country name, and address.
The implementation is grounded in object-oriented programming principles, emphasizing the creation of manual data structures since the use of STL containers is expressly prohibited. The application features a command-line interface for user interaction, supporting commands for adding, finding, and deleting hotel records, as well as exporting the database content to a text file for persistence.

Key functionalities include:
Managing hotel records with detailed attributes.
Efficient searching of hotels by city or a combination of city and star rating.
Adding new records or updating existing ones based on a unique key.
Deleting records and exporting the database content to a file.
